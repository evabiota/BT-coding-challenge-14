# Comments & decisions
The structure is not responsive. I did'nt add any media queries because initially was not required. I've done it with flex-box, so it would be ready to wrap and add the media queries.<br>
I used scss.<br>
I used the margins, heights font-sizes, etc. specified in the figma file. <br>
Please notice that the clip path in the second set of images is not perfect, I could had spent more time drawing the vectorbut I thought the idea was to see I know how to clip an image.<br>
Decided to use just 2 separated css files because I thought the code was simple. I could had used more and compile in one .css but I didn't think was needed this time.<br>
I changed some images because was more comfortable for me than using the figma ones.<br>
I changed some animations because it looked better for me.<br>
Feel free to ask anything you want.
