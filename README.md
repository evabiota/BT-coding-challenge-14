# Comments
The structure is not responsive, I did'nt add any media queries because initially was not requested. With some more time I could do it since I used flex-box.<br>
I didn't link the sections to not to use more js on the scrolling effect. I focussed on the scroll animations without using the navigation. I could do it but I would need more js.<br>
Please note that the clip path in the second set of images is not perfect, I could had spent more time drawing the vectorbut I thought the idea was to see I know how to clip an image.
